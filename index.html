      <div id="introduction" class="tab active" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="btn-introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Sylvia Wang, and I'm 16 years old. I'll be sharing my journey as a taekwondo poomsae athlete and a basketball player. These short chapters reflect my personal experiences and insights — the lessons, the transitions, and the moments that have shaped me — and I hope they help you along your path.</p>
        <p>First and foremost, I want to acknowledge everything sports has given me: the lessons I've learned, the people I've met, the places I've gone, and the personal growth I've experienced. I'm especially thankful to all the coaches who have guided me and helped shape the person I'm becoming. Being able to do what I do is a privilege, and I'm truly grateful for every step of the journey.</p>
        <p>As you read through the following paragraphs, keep in mind that they only represent my personal perspectives and values at this moment as I’m going through the journey. I believe that there is a lot in front of me yet to be discovered, to be learned.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="quote" class="tab" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="btn-quote">
        <h2>"Ignore the Noise, Rise Above the Chaos"</h2>
        <p>I’d like to start by sharing my favorite quote — my motto: “Ignore the noise, rise above the chaos.”</p>
        <p>This quote is applicable in sports but also far beyond sports. “Noise” and “chaos” represent everything around you: the distractions, the pressure, the doubt, the outside opinions. This can include the cheering, the booing, the trash talks, your opponents, your own nerves…everything.</p>
        </p>
        <p>In those moments when everything feels overwhelming, it’s easy to get caught in the chaos. And when you let the noise take over, you lose sight of your purpose. To be different, to succeed, to reach your goals — you have to ignore the noise.
</p>
        <p>This means that when people are not doing their work when they should, you don’t care about what they’re doing, you do your thing, do what you should do. This means that when people make comments about you, whether good or bad, you don’t try and fight back — you keep doing what you’re doing and prove them wrong if you need to.</p>
        <p>The competitive world is full of chaos. But while others get trapped in it, you can choose to block out everything and stay locked in on your priorities. Rising above the chaos isn’t something that happens overnight. It’s the result of consistently choosing to ignore distractions. It’s about reaching the state where the louder the chaos gets, the stronger you become.
</p>
        <p>And when you get there, you’ll rise — </p>
        <p>Rise above the noise.</p>
        <p>Rise above the chaos.</p>
        <p>Rise above everyone who let it get in their way.</p>
        
        
        
      </div>

      <div id="strength" class="tab" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="btn-strength">
        <h2>Use Your Strength</h2>
        <p>In every sport, each athlete have unique strengths that can lead them to success. No matter how good you are or how bad you are, you gotta recognize your strength and use it.
</p>
        <p>Take for example, in basketball, every player is looking for a mismatch. Teams create plays for tall players to go against shorter opponents, for fast players to go against slower players, for strong players to go against weaker opponents. When a small guard ends up facing a big opponent who is a lot taller than themself, it doesn’t necessarily mean they have a disadvantage. Yes, the big opponent can be stronger, but the guard has to think about their strength. Maybe the guard is faster, maybe the guard is more agile. The guard can use their speed to beat the big opponent and score. 
</p>
        <p>Since every person is unique, every matchup is in some way a mismatch, and there is always a way that you can use your strength to win.</p>
        <p>This is the same in taekwondo. You might think that you have no power, you are not flexible and therefore you are not a good athlete and you can’t win. Keep in mind that physical strength is not the only type of strength. Your strength can be that you are calm and therefore you are able to perform to the best of your ability when you are on the stage. Or your strength could be that you are a fast learner who can perfect techniques faster than others. You gotta take some time to recognize your strength and think about how your strength can make you different, bringing you to the next level.
</p>
        <p>Personally, I have recognized being smart as my biggest strength. I am not the most flexible, I do not have the most power, but I am smart. I used to think that intelligence is for academics, but I have learnt that some strengths can be utilized in multiple things that you’re doing. So, I recognized the fact that I am smart and I used it as much as I can to become who I am today. I studied clips, thought about the most efficient way to train, analyzed why I won, why I lost, what I need to do better and most importantly how I learn the fastest and how I can improve the fastest. 
</p>
        <p>It is true that some people are more talented and some people are physically superior, but that is not something you can change. While admiring others’ strengths, don’t forget to look at yourself and see what’s in you that is special that can make you successful.</p>
        
      </div>

      <div id="win" class="tab" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="btn-win">
        <h2>The importance of Wanting to Win</h2>
        <p>This is one of the lessons I learned the hard way. I was in Montreal for the Canada Open, and I lost to an opponent I could’ve beaten. At first, I never thought losing in a poomsae competition could come down to your mentality—the mindset you have when you're performing, the mindset you have as you step onto the mats. Right after the loss, I reviewed my video and concluded that my opponent had more power than I did, and that’s why she won. At the moment, although it did not make perfect sense to me, I chose to believe that was why lost.
</p>
        <p>However, later on, as the match continued to bother me, I took some time and dived deeper to think about what might have gone wrong that day that made the result the way it was. I started thinking about the difference in mindset between me and my opponent. I figured that I lost because I didn’t want to win as much as my opponent did. She had traveled all the way from Germany to Canada, and she clearly came to compete. In contrast, despite traveling to Montreal myself, I lacked the confidence and the will to win. It wasn’t that I wanted to lose—but I didn’t truly believe I could win, and I didn’t want it badly enough. I wasn’t trying to win.
</p>
        <p>That realization changed everything. I learned that the way you approach a competition is just as important as your skill. Sometimes, it is not only about the skill you have, but about the heart you put into something, and how much you want to win. Since then, I’ve approached training and competitions like I never did. I became more hungry to pursue what I wanted and never let go of the thought that “I want to win.” 
</p>
        <p>Two months later came BC Taekwondo Championships. I stepped onto the mats like a completely different person, this time, I cared about nothing but winning. And I did. Especially in close matches, success isn't solely about physical conditions, but about mindset and desire. With determination and the right mindset, limitations are there to be overcome and goals are there to be achieved.
</p>
        
        
      </div>

      <div id="winorlearn" class="tab" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="btn-winorlearn">
        <h2>Win or Learn</h2>
        <p>“You either win or you learn” is something my coach always reminds us of. When I first heard it, I thought it was just a way to make people feel better after losing. It didn’t really click with me at first. But over time, as I began to reflect on my own experiences—especially the times when things didn’t go my way—I realized how much I was actually learning from those moments. Slowly, I began to see the truth in that statement.</p>
        <p>However, I would like to rephrase this sentence, I believe that instead of “You either win or you learn,” it is more accurate to say “You may not always win, but you always learn.” This is to clarify that you can learn not only when you lose, but also when you win. No matter what, there’s always a lesson. You learn from everything, from every experience.
</p>
        <p>Take a moment and think about these questions: When you lose a game, a match, or a competition, do you really lose anything? Do you lose a medal? No! You just didn’t get one, you didn’t lose one. Instead, what you do gain is experience. That experience helps you grow and become better at whatever you are doing.
</p>
        <p>And this idea goes far beyond sports or competitions—it applies to life itself. Everyone faces ups and downs, highs and lows. It is inevitable and you just have to figure to take it as nutrients. During those challenging or disappointing times, it might feel like you've lost. But even then, there's always something to be learned. That’s why it’s so important to see losses not as failures, but as opportunities. They give you a chance to reflect, understand what went wrong, and use that insight to do better next time.
</p>

      <div id="mainandsupport" class="tab" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="btn-mainandsupport">
        <h2>Main Sport vs. Supporting Sport</h2>
        <p>Having a supporting sport, or even multiple supporting sports, is extremely common. The real difference between a supporting sport and a main one isn't just about skill. It's about commitment. It's about how much time, energy, and heart you're willing to give.
</p>
        <p>Taekwondo has been my supporting sport since I started. As a multi-sport athlete, I used to spend thirty hours a week on sports. I never took taekwondo as the one sport I cared about the most or the one sport I really cared about succeeding or not. It was more of a place where I got to discover my strengths and weaknesses and worked on them for the improvement of my other sport. I focused more on thinking about how I could imply skills from taekwondo to my other sports. Taekwondo was truly a suitable supporting sport for me, I’ve learned to incorporate the methods of generating power and speed into other sports. </p>
        <p>However, from my understanding, most of my opponents and competitive athletes in taekwondo dedicate a lot of time and effort in the sport. And so to reach the next level, I had to make a choice. At the end, I switched over to taekwondo, specifically poomsae. It is now my main and only sport. The process was tough, I missed basketball a lot and I often wonder if I made the right decision. 
</p>
        <p>Focusing on one sport can be dry and boring, however, it is only when I put all my full attention into taekwondo that I realized how taekwondo is truly beyond the sport itself. It stopped being just a sport. It became a way of thinking, of growing. It became a mirror, showing me who I really was and what I still had to learn.
</p>
        <p>I had the privilege of training in Toronto with some of the best athletes in Canada and learning from different coaches. It was not just about the skills and techniques in taekwondo, but about learning from high-level and experienced individuals. I learned from their way of leading, communicating, motivating and inspiring. These weren't just sports lessons. They were life lessons. Lessons I'll carry far beyond the mat.</p>

        <h2>More About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Sylvia Wang, a 16-year-old athlete specializing intaekwondo poomsae. I'm currently part of the High-Performance Poomsae Team at Master Tony Kook's Taekwondo, where I train under Master Jo.
</p>
        <p>I've been fortunate to compete at provincial and national levels. I'm proud to have won two consecutive BC Championships in the junior pair division with different partners. I also won the BC Taekwondo Championship in the junior female individual division.
</p>
        <p>This book is a collection of the lessons, challenges, and growth I've experienced through sports. I wrote it to reflect on my path as well as to encourage and inspire others who may be on their own athletic or personal journey. I still have a lot to learn, but if there's one thing I've discovered so far, it's this: the most meaningful victories happen not on a scoreboard, but within ourselves.
